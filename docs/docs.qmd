While making this project some very important things that I learnt were:

- What is cookie-cutter and poetry and what is their use
- How to save and call our functions from separate file
- How to geoencode our locations
- What is API and how it is used
- To use .env files to keep secrets, ie, the links that are private to us 
- Usage of requests library
- When to use dataclasses
- How to perform geospatial analysis
- How to remove previously added unwanted files from github only
- How to save our model using joblib and load it later
- How to add image with link to file

You can also check my [Github](https://github.com/AnshikaJain2405/OrionDataAnalyticsInternshipJul23-Proj2/) repo for the same.
